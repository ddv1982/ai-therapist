# Workflows with Cline

- **Folder-Based Rules**
  - This `.clinerules/` folder contains focused, toggleable rules grouped by concern.
  - Keep each file single-purpose for clarity and easy toggling.

- **Using the Toggle UI**
  - Use Cline’s rules popover to enable/disable specific rule files as the context changes (e.g., enable `03-api-and-openapi.md` when working on endpoints).

- **Maintenance**
  - When adding a new standard, create a new file or update the most relevant existing one.
  - Prefer concise, outcome-focused guidelines over verbose narratives.

- **Reference**
  - See Cline’s folder system and toggle docs: `https://docs.cline.bot/features/cline-rules`.
