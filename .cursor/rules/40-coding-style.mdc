# Coding Style for TypeScript/React

- Prefer explicit function signatures for exported APIs.
- Avoid unsafe casts or `any`. Use precise types.
- Use meaningful, descriptive names (avoid 1â€“2 character identifiers).
- Use guard clauses and handle errors early.
- Do not catch errors without meaningful handling.
- Prefer multi-line over overly clever one-liners and deep nesting.
- Match existing formatting and avoid unrelated reformatting.
- Keep comments concise and focused on the "why".

## UI Conventions
- Use the same font consistently across the chat interface.
- Hide scrollbars by default in chat views unless explicitly needed.
