## Problem Statement

### The Mental Health Crisis

Mental health challenges affect millions of people globally, yet significant barriers prevent many from seeking or receiving help:

1. **Accessibility Barriers**
   - Limited availability of licensed therapists in many regions
   - Long wait times (weeks or months) for appointments
   - High costs ($100-300 per session) without adequate insurance coverage
   - Stigma associated with seeking traditional therapy

2. **Availability Constraints**
   - Traditional therapy operates during business hours only
   - No immediate support during crisis moments
   - Lack of continuity between weekly sessions
   - Limited options for ongoing reflection and journaling

3. **Privacy Concerns**
   - Fear of judgment from human therapists
   - Concerns about medical records and insurance implications
   - Difficulty opening up about sensitive topics
   - Worry about confidentiality breaches

4. **Gap in Continuity**
   - No support system between therapy sessions
   - Inability to practice therapeutic techniques in real-time
   - Lost insights and moments that occur outside scheduled appointments

### The Opportunity

While AI cannot and should not replace human therapists, it can serve as a complementary tool that:

- Provides immediate, 24/7 support for emotional processing
- Offers a judgment-free space for exploration and self-reflection
- Bridges the gap between therapy sessions
- Makes therapeutic frameworks accessible to those who cannot afford traditional therapy
- Helps users develop coping skills through real-time practice
