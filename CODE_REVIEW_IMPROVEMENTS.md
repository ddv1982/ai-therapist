# Code Review Improvements

This document summarizes the recommended improvements identified during the code review of the **AI Therapist** project.

---

## âœ… Strengths
- Clear project structure with Next.js App Router, Redux, Prisma, and Redis.
- Consistent API middleware usage (`withApiMiddleware`, `withAuthAndRateLimit`).
- Strong test coverage (unit, integration, e2e, and security).
- Internationalization support with `i18n`.
- Security-conscious design (auth, encryption, TOTP, rate limiting).

## ðŸš€ Improvements to Make

### 1. API Consistency
- [ ] Migrate all API routes to use standardized `ApiResponse<T>` and `getApiData`.
- [ ] Ensure all routes include `X-Request-Id` headers for traceability.
- [ ] Remove legacy response shapes (e.g. memory endpoints).

### 2. Error Handling
- [ ] Adopt a consistent error-handling strategy with structured error responses.
- [ ] Provide meaningful error messages instead of generic catches.

### 3. Redux & State Management
- [ ] Refactor Redux slices (`chatSlice.ts`, `sessionsSlice.ts`) to use **RTK Query** for API integration.
- [ ] Reduce boilerplate by leveraging RTK Query caching and auto-generated hooks.

### 4. Type Safety
- [ ] Eliminate `any` usage in UI components (e.g. `command-palette.tsx`).
- [ ] Strengthen TypeScript types across props and API responses.
- [ ] Enforce stricter ESLint/TSConfig rules for type safety.

### 5. Performance
- [ ] Review Redis cache invalidation strategies to ensure consistency.
- [ ] Optimize React components (`chat-composer.tsx`, `session-sidebar.tsx`) with `React.memo` and `useCallback`.
- [ ] Audit re-renders in chat-related components.

### 6. Styling & Design System
- [ ] Consolidate global CSS (`globals.css`, `base.css`) with Tailwind utilities.
- [ ] Move towards a unified design system for consistent UI patterns.
- [ ] Document reusable UI components.

### 7. Documentation
- [ ] Expand `README.md` with:
  - Setup instructions (DB, Redis, env vars).
  - API usage examples.
  - Deployment guidelines.
- [ ] Add developer onboarding guide.

### 8. Validation
- [ ] Introduce **Zod** schemas for request validation in API routes.
- [ ] Ensure all inputs are validated before processing.

### 9. Streaming APIs
- [ ] Adopt `withAuthAndRateLimitStreaming` for chat endpoints to support real-time responses.
- [ ] Ensure streaming endpoints follow the same auth and rate-limit rules.

### 10. Observability
- [ ] Add structured logging (e.g. `pino`) for API requests and errors.
- [ ] Integrate monitoring/metrics for API performance.

### 11. Accessibility (a11y)
- [ ] Review UI components (`command-palette.tsx`, `chat-composer.tsx`) for ARIA roles.
- [ ] Ensure full keyboard navigation support.
- [ ] Add accessibility tests.

## ðŸ“Œ Next Steps
1. Prioritize **API consistency** and **validation** to improve reliability.
2. Refactor Redux slices to **RTK Query** for cleaner state management.
3. Improve **type safety** and **error handling** across the codebase.
4. Expand **documentation** for contributors and deployment.
5. Add **observability** and **a11y improvements** for production readiness.
